Various tools to make running AF3 easier and set ups that have worked.

# REPO STATUS
**In progress**: This repository is in progress. It is not done or usable at this time. 

# About

## What is this repo?
This repository is simply 1. a few tools to make AF3 easier to run 2. Custom configurations that I have gotten to successfully run. This does not gaurantee that it will work for you

## Why?
1. Getting everything to work was a bit of the pain since it did not work 'out of the box'
2. If I get atomized by an F350 on my commute into work at least this will still be usable by others.

## Repo Contents
* /af3_tools/repo_configurations - Folders holding files and information on specific configurations I have gotten to successfully run. Includes specific AF3 version, CUDA version (local), hardware, etc. This will also include step-by-step instructions that are *in addition to AF3 install isntructions* to get things working.  
* /af3_tools/af3_tools.py - Various tools to make running AF3 easier. For example, generating the AF3-compatible .json file from .fasta files.

## Roadmap
1. Document functional configurations
2. Create .fasta to .json tool
3. Integrate alternative MSA tools as well as functionality to convert their output into AF3-compatible input
4. Other things I come up with along the way.
